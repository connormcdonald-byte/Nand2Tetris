# Nand2Tetris
Projects for the computer engineering course 'Build a Modern Computer from First Principles'. The goal is to start with a NAND gate and build a 16 bit computer with an OS and programs. The high-level overview is:

Each project builds on the former; the bulk of the work starts at project 6. The projects are:
1. The basic Logic gates
2. Arithmetic gates for the ALU
3. Memory Hardware (registers, RAM)
4. Machine Language
5. Create the computer (uses the Von Neumann architecture)
6. Design the assembler, one layer of abstraction above binary code.

Use a VM (virtual machine) layer as a bridge between the high-language level (JACK) and the lower level machine code.
